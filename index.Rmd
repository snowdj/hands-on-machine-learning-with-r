Welcome to the supplementary website for [*Hands-On Machine Learning with R*](http://bit.ly/HOML_with_R). This project aims to teach you the fundamentals
of Machine Learning with the R machine learning tech stack and this website is
designed to provide you with additional content and resources that we could not
include in the hard copy book such as:

* An environment to run code from the book
* Chapter exercises
* Direct access to the data sets
* Slides from relevant workshops
* Errata

With the exception of the book, all this content is [CC BY 4.0 licensed](LICENSE.md).

## Quick Start

Want to reproduce the code in the book without having to install anything? Go to
our [RStudio Cloud project](https://rstudio.cloud/project/801185) and you will
find R notebooks containing the code for each chapter's code chunks, figures,
and tables. Learn more about RStudio Cloud [here](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/guide).
