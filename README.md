# Hands-on Machine Learning with R

#### By Brad Boehmke & Brandon Greenwell

<br>

Welcome to the supplementary repository for [*Hands-On Machine Learning with R*](http://bit.ly/HOML_with_R). This project aims to teach you the fundamentals
of Machine Learning with the R machine learning tech stack and this website is
designed to provide you with additional content and resources that we could not
include in the hard copy book such as:

* An environment to run code from the book
* Chapter exercises
* Direct access to the data sets
* Slides from relevant workshops
* Errata

You can find these supplementary resources on the book's companion website (under heavy construction): https://koalaverse.github.io/homlr. With the exception of the book, all this content is [CC BY 4.0 licensed](LICENSE.md).
