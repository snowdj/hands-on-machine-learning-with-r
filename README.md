# Hands-on Machine Learning with R

This repository is the future home of the [*Hands-on Machine Learning with R*](http://bit.ly/HOML_with_R) book by [Brad Boehmke](https://github.com/bradleyboehmke/) and [Brandon Greenwell](https://github.com/bgreenwell).  The book is under development and will eventually be published by Chapman & Hall/CRC; however, it has not undergone the formal review process. 

Currently, this repo provides a place to [ask questions or make comments](https://github.com/koalaverse/hands-on-machine-learning-with-r/issues) about the beta version of the book. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated and will help us make it better! Note that some chapters are incomplete and currently being worked on; you will recognize this by a warning at the beginning of the chapter. Although incomplete, even these chapters welcome comments for improvements.

Eventually, this repo will contain additional content to include but not limited to:

- Supporting code not shown in book
- Additional code examples for alternative solutions mentioned
- Slides that can be used to support chapters
- Chapter exercises
- Data sets used that are not available via an R package
